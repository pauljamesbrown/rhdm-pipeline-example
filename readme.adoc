= A Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment Approach for Kogito Business Rules.

Building and automating the deployment of business rules can appear to be a daunting challenge, especially when the rule changes are time critical.

In this post Iâ€™ll walk you through a basic approach for developing a Kogito Business Rule and deploying that rule using an automated pipeline using kubernetes.

The technology used includes: 

* Kogito Rules Management using DMN - https://kogito.kie.org/get-started/
* Openshift - Kubernetes platform
* Tekton -  Cloud Native pipelines - https://tekton.dev/
* ArgoCD - Kubernetes GitOps tool - https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
* Kustomize - Kubernetes config management - https://kustomize.io/
